# Introduction to DIALS, mdx2, NeXpy
### Tailored to users who aim to model inorganic materials using crystallographic software

<details>
<summary> DIALS </summary>
DIALS is documented on the DIALS github (link). DIALS is software used for indexing, peak finding, scaling and various other functions found (link to DIALS page), it is run entirely from the command line and has a basic UI to view data. DIALS should be installed in a clean environment preferably containing Python 3.10 (DIALS functions best on 3.10). DIALS can be installed using a package manager such as conda:
  
  ```
conda install -c conda-forge dials
conda install dxtbx/n # to read image headers 
```

<summary> Mdx2 </summary>
Mdx2 was released in 2022 at the Erice Data Reduction Workshop by the International School of Crystallography. Mdx2 is a valuable package for data analysis and to generate reciprocal space plots. 
Mdx2 can be downloaded from:  https://github.com/ando-lab/mdx2/archive/refs/tags/v0.3.0.zip
 First unzip and then move to the same directory as the dataset, then in the command line, run:
  
  ```
pip install -e
```
Subsequently, run:
  
  ```
mdx2.version
```
This should output the installed version of mdx2.

<summary> NeXpy </summary>
NeXpy is the GUI that accompanies Mdx2. NeXpy should be installed in a second environment running on python 3.9 (or the last stable release). NeXpy only processes files in a NexusFormat structure (.nxs). Hierarchal data formats such as .h5 can be converted to the NexusFormat using this (link) script
NeXpy can be installed using conda:

   ```
conda install -c conda-forge nexpy
conda install scipy  
```
