# XDS
- xds is run entirely through **XDS.INP**. In this file, you can specify the geometry and experimental parameters of your experiment. This function is necessary as most crystallographic experiments do not use standardised parameters.
- The most important files in xds are:
-   XDS.INP: command file
-   SPOT.XDS: peak file
-   XPARM.XDS: parameter file
## How to use XDS:
1. Via your command line, activate your python 3.9 environment/ last stable release environment and then go to your xds directory . 
2. XDS will try to find the unit cell for your inputted data, to run it, run 
```
% xds
```
- if this operation fails, run:
```
% cp SPOT.XDS SPOT.XDS_bak 
% head -n XXXX SPOT.XDS_bak > SPOT.XDS
% xds
```
- where XXXX is the number of Bragg peaks to be displayed. 
- this should output xds running through all the peaks. 

3. XPARM.XDS is the output file and can be read using a TextEdit application. It will be an array of numbers without headers, but from left to right can be approximately read as:

| - | Theta (angle) | X | Y | Z |
| :---         |     :---:      |   :---:    |   :---: | ---:
| Wavelength   | - | Vectors along Z     | Vectors along Z    | Vectors along Z   |
| - | - |  Unit Cell Lengths & Angles    | Unit Cell Lengths & Angles      | Unit Cell Lengths & Angles      |
| - | - | Dimension | _ | Dimension 

4. Now that you have the necessary information to proceed (peaks and parameters), you can move on to Meerkat or start processing with DIALS.
